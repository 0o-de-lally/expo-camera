# INSTALL
```
npm install
# or
bun install
```
expo supports `bun`. For the SaaS deployment (EAS), you must preserve the lockfile `bun.lockb`, otherwise it will use yarn.

# NOTES

### Expo uses babel.config.js
This does not seem necessary on typescript projects or using bun. When we create a new project with `bun create expo` there is no babel file created.

### tsconfig.json

The tsconfig file is autogenerated, it should ne ignored.
